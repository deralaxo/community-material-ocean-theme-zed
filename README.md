# Community Material Ocean Theme for Zed

I ported the Community Material Ocean Theme straight from my beloved VSCode's Community Material Ocean Theme. Pretty sure it first stared as "Deep Ocean" theme.

The VSCode extension I ported it from: [Aries Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aries.aries)

To have almost exact same highlighting as VSCode's **Community Material Ocean Theme**, you can also install the other extension created in pair with this one.
